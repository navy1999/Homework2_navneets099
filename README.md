## Building and Running the template

The project uses _Gradle_ build system to compile, package and to run junit tests. In case you are unable to run the below `gradle` commands, please check compatibility of the installed _JDK_ against that of _Gradle (7.4)_. You may have to lower your _JDK_ version to be compatible to that of _Gradle_ ([compatibility matrix](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html)). For reference, we have used _openjdk 17.0.12_ to validate this project.

Before executing the `gradlew` script, please make the script excutable:

Linux: `chmod +x gradlew`

### Building the project and running unit test

Run the following command to build the project and run the juint tests:

Linux: `./gradlew build`

Windows: `./gradlew.bat build`

### Running Unit Test

Run the following command to run the junit test, without re-building the project:

Linux: `./gradlew test`

Windows: `./gradlew.bat test`

The unit tests are expected to fail (or even run forever) as is, due to missing implementations. 
**One of your objective is to ensure that the corresponding tests for your implementations pass**
Again, **Do not modify the provided unit tests..** 

### Building Test and Test2 main programs:

Linux: ` ./gradlew build -x test`

Windows: `./gradlew.bat build -x test`
